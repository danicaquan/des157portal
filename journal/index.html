            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <p>01/29/23</p>
            <p>The article was quite informative and gave good tips to keep in mind for desigining for forms. A lot of it is based on how the human mind works, as you're designing it for usability rather than aesthetics (which is exemplified when the article talks about changing lengths of the boxes to match what kind of entry you are looking for rather than having it all my similarly sized, as our design sense might tell us to do). I thought the point about structuring the information that will be asked for on the form the most insightful because it reminds me of how I interact with forms and how I might get turned off on finishing it or frustrated by it, so it is definitely something I will always consider if I ever have to design forms... depending on the kind of form, of course.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a <a href="https://hellomyc.art">website</a> that I think has quite good form design. You have to go to checkout in order to see the form (most of the forms I encounter are inputting address/payment information), but the checkout uses a lot of practices mentioned in the article. For any pre-order item, there is an additional use of a checklist in order to make sure that the buyer is aware of waiting times before they can put it in the cart. Lengths of the entry boxes differ depedning on what information is meant to be put there. The checkout firsts asked only for your email--also states what it will use it for--then goes for more complex information, like your shipping address then payment information. Each item has label that always shows what information is meant to put be written, even if it is shown in the entry field of a non-active textbox (it changes size and position when you click on that box), which maintains information categorization as it does not conflict with the fact that the heading shows you are in the address section. The ative box is highlighted so you know where you are typing. It also shows the next steps you have until you are finished with the form.</p>
