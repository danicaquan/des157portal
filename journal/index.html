                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <p>02/06/23</p>
                <p>I ended up reading both articles. They both share a lot of similar points about effective overlay use and designs. I think first article (linked below) focuses more on where to apply overlays while the second one (also linked below) elaborates more on about how to effectively implement them.</p>
                <p>Overlays aren't really things I think about when designing, but now that I think about it, they are actually quite prevelent in a lot of websites and apps we use--despite the fact that they're meant to be used sparingly. In fact, I used them in a project in DES112 (UI/UX Design: Principles & Practices), but I didn't put too much attention into whether or not I should use them. It felt natural to me, likely because I was just following a lot of design patterns I saw in the mobile apps I often use. I think what I used them for, which was user-based confirmation, generally aligned with the information presented in the articles. Outside of user-prompted confirmation overlays and some mobile features, I think I mostly see them for coupons or ads on shopping sites. Charity sites often use them to draw attention to donation too, which I noticed while doing research for DES112. This kind of goes against the best practicies for overlays as mentioned in the articles, but I suppose from a marketing perspective, it does really catch your attention when you load into a site and immediately get confronted by a pop-up. In this case, they're definitely effective in making the user aware of whatever information the site wants to inform them of, provided that the overlay is eye-catching and does not have too many words... but I don't know if the users enjoy this, haha.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I think this is good information to keep in mind. Although I haven't really used overlays in my designs so far, this made me much more aware of the issues bad designs can create and will serve as good reference for when I do use overlays in my designs.</p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <p>01/29/23</p>
                <p>The article was quite informative and gave good tips to keep in mind for desigining for forms. A lot of it is based on how the human mind works, as you're designing it for usability rather than aesthetics (which is exemplified when the article talks about changing lengths of the boxes to match what kind of entry you are looking for rather than having it all my similarly sized, as our design sense might tell us to do). I thought the point about structuring the information that will be asked for on the form the most insightful because it reminds me of how I interact with forms and how I might get turned off on finishing it or frustrated by it, so it is definitely something I will always consider if I ever have to design forms... depending on the kind of form, of course.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a <a href="https://hellomyc.art">website</a> that I think has quite good form design. You have to go to checkout in order to see the form (most of the forms I encounter are inputting address/payment information), but the checkout uses a lot of practices mentioned in the article. For any pre-order item, there is an additional use of a checklist in order to make sure that the buyer is aware of waiting times before they can put it in the cart. Lengths of the entry boxes differ depedning on what information is meant to be put there. The checkout firsts asked only for your email--also states what it will use it for--then goes for more complex information, like your shipping address then payment information. Each item has label that always shows what information is meant to put be written, even if it is shown in the entry field of a non-active textbox (it changes size and position when you click on that box), which maintains information categorization as it does not conflict with the fact that the heading shows you are in the address section. The ative box is highlighted so you know where you are typing. It also shows the next steps you have until you are finished with the form.</p>
