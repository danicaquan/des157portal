    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>
    <article>
    <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
    <p></p>The project I intend to expand upon for the final is the Game On! Project. I want to update it by transforming the game into something more interactive that focuses a little more on strategy than just chance. I also want to add more visual and auditory features, specifically more sound effects and animations.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
        <p> My current goals for the project is to better the interaction of the game and make it more engaging (both in game-play and graphics/audio). Honestly, the game of Pig as is... pretty boring. It focuses a lot on chance and is a little one-sided; whoever rolls first has a huge advantage unless they roll a 1. The chances of rolling a 1 are pretty low as it's a 1/6 chance per dice. Therefore, I want to make it a little more interesting and something people would have to think more while playing.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
    <p>Although the direction might change, I plan on adding game UI elements that are typical for a lot of action/rpg games like HP bars. The type will like follow the similar "game" theme as well. I have a few ideas on the concept: it might continue to be based off of Genshin Impact characters: either expanding upon my Game On! project with Yelan or changing the characters (perhaps Ayato and Itto). More likely, I will base it off my and my friends' D&D characters and have it take place in a tavern.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
    <p>I would like to add some sound effects for different events and action in the game: such as winning and losing, clicking buttons, and the characters losing health. Additionally I would love to implement some animation into the game: whether it be the dice rolling, or the characters changing expression and moving when they lose health. I would love to add some narrative as well, such as adding some dialogue between characters</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
        <p>
            So my current plan is to make it similar to war. Before your rolls, you choose between some actions and then the system will compare your dice rolls and execute the results accordingly. I want to give the users more of a sense of choice in the gameplay and that it actually will affect the outcome of the game. Alongside that, I am hoping implementing more interaction and narrative will make the website more interesting. If I implement more narrative, it will set up why this battle is happening in the first place and to make the setting more immersive.
