    <title>Final: Creative Brief</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Still in Progress of Writing (Sorry!)</h2>
    <p>Project Summary: The project I intend to expand upon for the final is the Game On! Project by transforming it into a more interactive game that focuses a little more on strategy than just chance.</p>
    <p>Project Goals: My current goals for the project is to better the interaction of the game. Honestly, the game of Pig as is... is pretty boring. It focuses a lot on chance and is a little one-sided: whoever rolls first has a huge advantage unless they roll a 1. I want to make it a little more interesting and something people would be more interested in playing.</p>

    <p>Design Strategies: Articulate your plans for the overall look and feel (visual strategies, such as formal details including color and type). Use language that includes design elements, design principles and Gestalt. 
        Generally I plan on going forward with my current aesthetic, but add some more game UI elements that are typical for a lot of action/rpg games</p>
        
    <p>Interaction Strategies: Articulate your plans for interactions, including time-based behaviors, visual and aural feedback, inputs, etc. I would like to add some sound effects (currently I do not have any) for the dice rolling. Additionally I would love to implement some animation into the game: whether it be the dice rolling.</p>
        
    <p> Experience Goals: Articulate your goals for intended/desired experiences for the users and how you plan to achieve them.
        So my current plan is to make it similar to war. Before your rolls, you choose and the player/CPU--I haven't fully decided)--will compare your dice rolls
